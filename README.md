Problem Statement

The number of apps, contacts, songs etc. in a user’s smartphone are in hundreds these days which makes it very tedious for the user to get quick access to one. Apps usually have to be looked/searched for. And in case of songs/contacts it gets even worse. Mak- ing icons on home screen is a solution, but it has its limitations as the usage changes weekly, if not daily, for an average user. Our goal is to make a widget + mobile application which can detect users’ usage pat- tern and accordingly serve as a platform to smoothen the android smart phone experi- ence.

Introduction

Proposed Solution

Our goal is to develop an Artificial Intelligence driven Mobile Application which can: [I] Help the user search through their mobile phone data and display their results ranked in an order [II] Display most relevant apps/contacts/songs at a particular instance on user’s home screen based on a number of parameters driven from user’s past interactions and us- age. This shall be achieved via Aritficial Intelligence.

Data Set

Initially we only have list of apps, contacts and songs to work with as our data set while our search history is empty. It will start building when user will start using the app and putting up search queries. Each time an application or service will be opened, it will also be recorded in data set. It will gradually store all data and will be able to predict user activity using current parameters and search history.

Results

We Developed an android application which can predict which app or service a person is most likely to use at any given instance using user’s past history as well as current parameters as discussed above. We also developed a home screen widget for the same, which allows the user to open an app or service directly from his or her home screen.
